                          PLAY NINE

Game Rule:

 1. When the game starts, you get a random number of stars between 1 and 9, and you have the set of numbers in the bottom frame that you can use.

 2. You can select one or more numbers that would sum up to the value of the random stars.

 3. The objective is to correctly use all the numbers here in the bottom frame. If you end up with a number of stars that has no possible correct combination, you get to redraw, which you can do five times.

 4. After that, if you still end up with a number of stars that has no possible correct combination out of all the remaining numbers, then you lose the game.

 FOR EXAMPLE:

  We have 3 stars, so we can do either 3 or 2 and 1. Check the answer. We get an indication that the answer is correct, and when we can click again to accept the answer, both 1 and 2 will be marked as used, and we'll get a new number of stars, but there will be a situation where we can't select any correct answer, so this is the case where we can redraw and see if we can get a correct answer. So if we select the last number then we win this game, and we can play again. So if I didn't have any redraws that is 0 redraws and still numbers are present but cannot press the correct number for shown stars then it will be Game Over!


  Let's play!!!
